"When I am gone, release me. Let me go.
<br>
I have so many things to see and do.
<br>
You mustn't tie yourself to me with tears.
<br>
Be happy that we had so many beautiful years.
<br>
I gave to you my love. You can only guess
<br>
How much you gave to me in happiness.
<br>
I thank you for the love you each have shown,
<br>
But now it's time I traveled on alone.
<br>
So grieve a while for me, if grieve you must.
<br>
Then let your grief be comforted by trust.
<br>
It's only for a while that we must part,
<br>
So bless the memories within your heart.
<br>
I won't be far away, for life goes on.
<br>
So if you need me, call and I will come.
<br>
Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near.
<br>
And if you listen with your heart,
<br>
You'll hear all my love around you soft and clear.
<br>
And then, when you must come this way alone,
<br>
I'll greet you with a smile and say welcome home..."
